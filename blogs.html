It has come to a point where anything you want can be bought on the internet, or any type of information you need can be found there. Simon Kemp (2019), a journalist for wearesocial.com, states that there are 4.39 billion internet users in 2019, an increase of 366 million (9 percent) versus January 2018. With the user amount growing tremendously each year, it is obvious that our capstone groups should be found on the internet. </h3></center></font>

	<font color = "darkgreen"><font size = "4"> <center><h3>At the start of capstone one, we were told that having a website was required for each capstone group. At first, it sounded like unneeded work that would never be used. After going through the class and working with my group mates last semester, we now know that the website is essential to our brand and getting our name out to the world. Other benefits of the website include, looking professional in front of potential business partners or investors in addition to being able to stay organized and have all of our work in one place. At the beginning of capstone one, my team and I made the bold decision of coding/creating our website from scratch to try and stand out along with having a fun, creative way of showing our ideas. The idea of having full customization is something that we have been able to appreciate when presenting and getting compliments about our website. Finally, I think that if a business or company is looking into creating a website, I would highly recommend doing so, not only does it allow potential users to find you easily but it creates a new look of professionalism and organization to for your project. </h3></center></font>

Another one of our ideas is that we reconstruct the damaged goods, wiping their memories, and give them back to community centers, people in need, or retirement homes as a means of reusing the tech, and saving the earth.

According to Melanie Haselmayr from AllBusiness.com, there are several benefits from creating a mobile app for your business. One benefit is that an app creates a direct marketing channel, which means that you can use the app to inform users of updates, locations, and just general information while also sending push notification to make direct contact. An app can also provide recognition because the more you get customers to use your app the more they are inclined to use your service. 
We can reap these benefits by creating our own app which will exhibit these benefits. We will create a direct channel to our users by making a map function to locate our recycling bins.

We have just finished our commercial (link provided) and are working on getting our product started in our school by notifying the students about what we’re doing on the morning announcements. Our SOW forms have been completed and filled out by Mr. Henry and(soon to be)Mrs. Furnari.We are now planning what we will have Mr.Henry say to promote us over the morning announcements. The work is coming together really well and we should have everything set and ready in the coming weeks. 
	As far as how our group has been working together, we have been progressing well as a group. We joke and play around a lot but we develop a lot of work despite that. Our chemistry is becoming better and better and everyone is becoming more susceptible to taking orders. We are growing at a fast rate and it is showing in the work we are producing! We will continue to produce work of this high caliber throughout our capstone journey.

Also, we were lacking some details to really draw our viewer. What we did in turn, was take advice from our instructor Mr.Jackman and really try to draw in the viewers by adding more of the reasons to recycle your e-waste as well as using music to set the tone of the commercial and switched over to a program called, “Powtoon” which fit our needs much better. </h3></center></font>

DeFranzo from SnapSurvey.com, she claims that there are a couple major reasons as to why surveys are important to business. The first reason she states is that assuming the survey is in a non-intimidating environment respondents are likely to give honest and meaningful opinions that could help steer your company in the right direction.  Another reason provided is that surveys produce unbiased results or feedback than can greatly affect the success of your team. This is because making decisions on unbiased data instead of “gut feeling” can save you time and resources.

The second step is to undertake research on the products that are on your list. The third step is to create a product comparison table that clearly organizes all your research.

It can create brand awareness, engage customers, and increase sales which will be very beneficial to any company. According to Jenna Gross from movingtargets.com, there are several reasons why marketing is invaluable to any company. The most obvious is that when you first start a company people probably don’t know about your product or what it does so a good marketing plan can solve that. It can inform people about the ins and outs of your product. Secondly she suggests that marketing now is easier than ever because it’s free by posting on social media platforms you can easily spread the news about your product. Jenna also states that marketing makes it so that your company has a presence meaning that the public won’t forget about your brand. If you don’t continue your marketing over a long period of time consumers might forget about your product so it’s important to be consistent. </h3></center></font>
